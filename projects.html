          <h2>Gym Form Analysis App</h2>
          <p>An app that analyzes gym form using a recurrent neural network. By training on videos of correct and incorrect form for exercises such as pull-ups, it can detect mistakes in form and count repetitions, as well as provide personalized feedback on how to improve exercise form and ability (Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Tensorflow).</p>

          <h2>Spotifriends Web App and Recommendation Engine</h2>
          <p>A social extension to the existing Spotify web app. Allows users to react to playlists, comment on playlists, add notes to songs, and see what other users are actively listening to. Also allows users to see their own Spotify statistics as well as other users' statistics (if their profile is public), and allows users to message each other. Also comes with a recommendation algorithm powered by cosine similarity. (Typescript, Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Pytorch).</p>

          <h2>Environmental Data Dashboard</h2>
          <p>Helped create a data dashboard using Plotly Dash to aggregate and analyze various environmental datasets. Comes with several different features, such as various forms of statistical analysis and ability for researchers at UCLA Ecology and Evolutionary Biology to upload and download data (Plotly Dash).</p>

          <h2>House Number Recognition</h2>
          <p>Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify house address numbers from the SVHN dataset, achieving over 90% accuracy. Served as an introductory project to deep learning, focusing on image preprocessing, model architecture design, and performance evaluation (Pytorch).</p>

          <h2>Mancala (C++)</h2>
          <p>A C++ terminal game where users can play Mancala either against another player or a CPU. The user can play against the CPU on three different difficulties: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Through this project, I familiarized myself with fundamental programming concepts, such as inheritance, recursion, and polymorphism.</p>
